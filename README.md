## Building & running

To build the project, you will need `cabal`, which can be found [here](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).

To build, run `cabal new-build` in the root of the repo.

You can then either install the package globally running `cabal install`, or run the local build with `cabal new-run` (e.g. `cabal new-run . -- Examples/Code.dy`).
